# Release Notes

## 0.12.5

This release fixes wheel metadata discovery to be robust to non-normalized wheel names, metadata
directory names, or any combination of the two.

## 0.12.4

This release fixes extras handling when resolving a PEX's wheels.

## 0.12.3

This release fixes platform tag detection for macOS arm64 and Windows arm64 and amd64.

## 0.12.2

This release fixes the `venv` PEX tool from trampling Pip provided by PEX deps when `--pip` is
specified. At parity with Pex, a warning is issued if `--collisions-ok`; otherwise the tool exits
with an error message explaining the conflict and the remedies.

Additionally, the `repository extract` tool is changed to wait forever when `--serve`ing instead
of timing out at 5 seconds if the server fails to come up. This is, again, at parity with Pex. In
this case however, a `--timeout` option is added to control this.

## 0.12.1

This release fixes the `venv` PEX tool `--pip` option for Python 2.7.

## 0.12.0

This release introduces `pexrc inject --jobs` to control maximum parallelism when injecting PEXes
with native runtimes bringing parity with the equivalent Pex feature.

Additionally, this release fixes `pexrc inject` target detection for `linux_*` wheels; previously
only `{many,musl}linux` wheels were handled.

Finally, `--source` extraction from directory PEXes and for console scripts is fixed for the
`repository extract` PEX tool.

## 0.11.2

This release fixes another `repository info` `PEX_TOOLS` bug, fixes an inconsistency in interpreter
constraint rendering for CPython threaded and non-threaded implementations and fixes PEXrc venvs
missing `PEX_EXTRA_SYS_PATH` handling.

## 0.11.1

This release fixes bugs in the `repository {info,extract}` `PEX_TOOLS`.

## 0.11.0

This release adds support for PEX-INFO `overridden` and `excluded` dependencies.

## 0.10.0

This release adds support for `PEX_ROOT`. When `PEXRC_ROOT` is set in the environment, it is still
preferred, but if not, a subdir of `PEX_ROOT` will be used to house the pexrc cache.

Additionally, if the final calculated pexrc cache root is not writable, a temporary cache dir will
be established and a warning issued just as is the case for Pex.

## 0.9.2

This release fixes injected `--sh-boot` PEXes to have the same interpreter selection logic as PEX.

## 0.9.1

This release fixes injected PEXes to properly resolve from legacy PEXes on the PEX_PATH at runtime
when those legacy PEXes expose items from the wheel .data/ dir in wheel chroot stashes.

## 0.9.0

This release adds support for auto-scoping the clibs and python-proxies injected into PEXes when
the PEX contains native wheels. For pure-Python PEXes, you still need to pare down manually using
`--target`.

## 0.8.0

This release adds support for "un-spreading" legacy PEX wheel chroots when injecting a PEXrc and
also for proper spreading of injected wheels at runtime. This covers all content delivered via
wheel .data/ dirs that was previously not handled by `pexrc`.

## 0.7.1

This release fixes injected `--sh-boot` PEXes to honor `PEX_TOOLS=1` and be robust to underlying
venv breaks due to system Python upgrades or uninstalls.

## 0.7.0

This release adds support for PEX_TOOLS when `pexrc` is built with the `tools` feature; e.g.:
```console
PEXRC_CLIB_FEATURES=tools cargo build ...
```

Releases now ship with this feature enabled.

## 0.6.0

This release adds support for installing venv console scripts.

## 0.5.0

This release wires PEX_VERBOSE to logging levels for both the `pexrc` tool and the runtime of the
injected PEXes it creates.

## 0.4.1

This release fixes user code support for `--no-pre-install-wheels` injected PEXes.

## 0.4.0

This release adds support for injecting `--no-pre-install-wheels` PEXes of all layout types.

## 0.3.1

This release fixes user code support for `--layout {loose,packed}` injected PEXes.

## 0.3.0

Add support for injecting `--layout loose` PEXes.

## 0.2.0

Add support for injecting `--layout packed` PEXes.

## 0.1.0 

Initial release.
